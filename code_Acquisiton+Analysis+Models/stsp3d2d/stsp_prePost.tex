\section{Short term synaptic plasticity from a whole cell approach}

The model can be thought of in terms of 3 main components. First, a system capable of producing spiking dynamics, which can be 2- or 3-dimensional in case bursting or spike frequency adaptation are required. Second, a 2- or 3-dimensional system that describes the dynamics of presynaptic release, and third, at least one more equation that describes the dynamics of postsynaptic activation upon release. 

\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_{t} c &=& \frac{c_{\infty}-c}{\tau_{c}} + f(t)
\\
\partial_{t} p &=&  \alpha ~c~(1-p) - \beta p  
\\
\partial_{t} x &=& x\lrRound{\frac{x_{\infty}-x}{\tau_{x}}} - 
x~p
\end{eqnarray}
where $f(c)$ represents the flux of \calcium into the terminal.
